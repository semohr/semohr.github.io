# Blog

The blog is maintained using markdown or ipython notebooks. I worte a short converter script that converts the markdown or ipynb files into html snippets, than these snippets are combined to create the blog page.


You can find the raw data i.e. the python scripts or markdown files in the `entries` folder. These files follow the naming scheme, `YYYY-MM-DD_NAME-OF-ENTRY` and are later sorted by the date. 
The code to generate the blog html file in the `scripts` folder.
