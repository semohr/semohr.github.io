          <p>I am a research assistant for statistical coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) research in the <a href="https://www.viola-priesemann.de/">priesemann group</a>. We have a variety of projects going on, but my main interest at the moment is to look into the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions for Europe. We are using the framework of Bayesian inference combined with Monte-Carlo methods to create a statistical model, which among other things is depending on country wide and age structural differences. It is quite the interesting work which we hope to publish soon. Additionally, I am working on my master studies and am still eager to expand my knowledge about numerical methods, computational science, and data science.</p>

                <p>How will the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic develop in the coming months and years? Based on an expert survey, we examine key aspects that are likely to influence COVID-19  in  Europe.  The  future  challenges  and  developments  will  strongly  depend  on  the progress of national and global vaccination programs, the emergence and spread of variants of concern, and public responses to nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). In the short term, many people are still unvaccinated, VOCs continue to emerge and spread, and mobility and population  mixing  is  expected  to  increase  over  the  summer.  Therefore,  policies  that  lift restrictions  too  much  and  too  early  risk  another  damaging  wave.  This  challenge  remains despite the reduced opportunities for transmission due to vaccination progress and reduced indoor mixing in the summer. In autumn 2021, increased indoor activity might accelerate the spreadagain, but a necessary reintroduction of NPIs might be too slow. The incidence may strongly rise again, possibly filling intensive care units, if vaccination levels are not high enough. A moderate, adaptive level of NPIs will thus remain necessary. These epidemiological aspects are  put  into  perspective  with  the  economic,  social,  and  health-related  consequences  and thereby provide a holistic perspective on the future of COVID-19.</p>

                <p>As SARS-CoV-2 is becoming endemic, a sustainable strategy to manage the pandemic is needed, especially when facing a steep wave. We identified a metastable regime at low case numbers, where test-trace-and-isolate (TTI) together with moderate contact reduction is sufficient to control the spread.</p>

                    <p>However, this control is lost once case numbers overwhelm the limited TTI capacity. Beyond that tipping point, increasingly more infectious individuals remain undetected, generating a self-accelerating spread. To reestablish control, a lockdown (circuit breaker) has to strike a delicate balance between duration, stringency, and timeliness; otherwise, lockdowns are ineffective, or their effect is soon lost. However, once reestablishing control at low case numbers, no additional lockdowns are necessary. In the long-term, immunity and large-scale testing will further facilitate the control of COVID-19.

                <p>A second wave of SARS-CoV-2 is unfolding in dozens of countries. However, this second wave manifests itself strongly in new reported cases, but less in death counts compared to the first wave. Over the past three months in Germany, the reported cases increased by a factor five or more, whereas the death counts hardly grew. This discrepancy fueled speculations that the rise of reported cases would not reflect a second wave but only wider testing. 
                </p>
                <p>We find that this apparent discrepancy can be explained to a large extent by the age structure of the infected, and predict a pronounced increase of death counts in the near future, as the spread once again expands into older age groups. To re-establish control, and to avoid the tipping point when TTI capacity is exceeded, case numbers have to be lowered. Otherwise the control of the spread and the protection of vulnerable people will require more restrictive measures latest when the hospital capacity is reached. </p>

                <p>Without a cure, vaccine, or proven long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2, test-trace-and-isolate (TTI) strategies present a promising tool to contain the viral spread.
                  For any TTI strategy, however, a major challenge arises from pre- and asymptomatic transmission as well as TTI-avoiders, which contribute to "hidden", unnoticed infection chains.

                    <p>In our semi-analytical model, we identified two distinct tipping points between controlled and uncontrolled spreading:
                      one, at which the behavior-driven reproduction number <math>R<sub>t</sub><sup>H</sup></math> of the hidden infections becomes too large to be compensated by the available TTI capabilities, and one at which the number of new infections starts to exceed the tracing capacity, causing a self-accelerating spread.</p>
                      <p>
                      We investigated how these tipping points depend on realistic limitations like limited cooperativity, missing contacts, and imperfect isolation, finding that TTI is likely not sufficient to contain the natural spread of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, complementary measures like reduced physical contacts and improved hygiene probably remain necessary.</p>

                  <p> The self-avoiding walk is one of the simples basic problems in statistical physics. Nonetheless, few properties can be determined in a rigorous mathematical fashion. In short a self-avoiding walk is a sequence of moves on a lattice also sometimes called a path. Theses paths are not allowed to cross over themself i.e. they do not visit a site more than once. One can use the framework of Monte Carlo methods to get good estimates for local and global properties of such paths. </p>

                      <p>In my bachelors thesis I looked at a further restricted type of self-avoiding walk, the periodic self-avoiding walk. These periodic self-avoiding walks have to additionally suffice periodic boundary conditions on a lattice. Overall there was a lot of work done for the normal self-avoiding walk but barely anything for the periodic case. Therefore, I choose the periodic self-avoiding walk as my topic for the bachelors thesis.</p>
                      <p>Specifically, I wrote a program for the enumeration of short periodic self-avoiding walks and another one for the Monte Carlo simulation of longer walks. I compared important properties such as end to end distance or gyration radius between the exact enumeration and the approximations from Monte Carlo simulation. All programs were written in C++ and the data was evaluated using python and matplotlib. If all of that sound interesting or fun to you, feel free to take a look.</p>

                  <p>The flocking algorithm was created by Craig Reynolds to simulate the as the name already tells "flocking" behaviour of birds. The algorithm was amongst others used to generate realistic behaving bat swarms in Tim Burton's Batman Returns (1992).</p>
                  <p>I used this algorithm to learn about OpenGL and 3D computer graphics in general. The small application was write in C++ using GLAD and GLFW. This created a I find very satisfying to watch animation. A short example can be seen on my github repository. </p>
